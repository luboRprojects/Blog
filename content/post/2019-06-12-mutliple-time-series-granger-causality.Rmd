We have recently submitted a paper about the short-term car registration forecasting. Forecasting models were based on several underlying variables which were analysed by a standard Vector Autoregressive Model. As the main purpose of the paper was not to present a black-box model with a good predictive power, we needed to analyse an importants of the car registration determinants.

A traditional approach to identify *"cause and effects"* in the context of time series analysis is to perform the Granger Causality test. Surprisingly, a treatment of the multivariate is not discussed much. Typically, two variables settings is presented with the caveat that solution works even for a more variables. This is only a partially true.

In the following text we will go through the simple 3 time-series example with various settings of interconnections.

## Three Variables, One driver

This example shows the analysis of the tree time series where the first time series *ts1* is a confounding time series.

```{r}
library(DiagrammeR)

df <- data.frame(col1 = c( "Cat", "Dog", "Bird"),
                 col2 = c( "Feline", "Canis", "Avis"), 
                 stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
uniquenodes <- unique(c(df$col1, df$col2))

nodes <- create_node_df(n=length(uniquenodes), nodes = seq(uniquenodes), type="number", label=uniquenodes)
edges <- create_edge_df(from=match(df$col1, uniquenodes), to=match(df$col2, uniquenodes), rel="related")

g <- create_graph(nodes_df=nodes, edges_df=edges)
render_graph(g)
#export_graph(g,
#file_name = "pic.png",
#file_type = "png")

#frameWidget(g, height = 350, width = '95%')
```

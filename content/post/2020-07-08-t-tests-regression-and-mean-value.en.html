<p>I have been asked by students about the difference between the “normal” t-test evaluating differences in mean values and the “regression” t-test several times. So, is there any difference? Let’s look the following example to get a practical intuition:</p>
<p>We will use the mtcars data set to test whether cars with manual transmission have different fuel consumption than cars with automatic transmission.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(dplyr)
data(&quot;mtcars&quot;)
boxplot(mtcars$cyl ~ mtcars$am)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2020-07-08-t-tests-regression-and-mean-value.en_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<pre class="r"><code>mtcars %&gt;% 
  group_by(am) %&gt;%
  summarise(mpgAvg = mean(mpg))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 2 x 2
##      am mpgAvg
##   &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1     0   17.1
## 2     1   24.4</code></pre>
<p>Let’s run the t-test for difference in means:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>t.test(mpg ~ am, var.equal = TRUE, data=mtcars)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 
##  Two Sample t-test
## 
## data:  mpg by am
## t = -4.1061, df = 30, p-value = 0.000285
## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group 0 and group 1 is not equal to 0
## 95 percent confidence interval:
##  -10.84837  -3.64151
## sample estimates:
## mean in group 0 mean in group 1 
##        17.14737        24.39231</code></pre>
<p>Let’s check the regression outcome (there is no need to code am as factor has only 2 levels).</p>
<pre class="r"><code>lm(mpg ~ am, data=mtcars) %&gt;%
  summary</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 
## Call:
## lm(formula = mpg ~ am, data = mtcars)
## 
## Residuals:
##     Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max 
## -9.3923 -3.0923 -0.2974  3.2439  9.5077

<p>t-statics from both tests result are identical in absolute value: 4.106.</p>
<p>The “normal” t-test tests whether there is any difference between conditional mean values of the dependent variable <span class="math inline">\(mpg\)</span>. Mean values are conditioned on the level of the independent variable <span class="math inline">\(am\)</span> (for the manual gear <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{am=man}\)</span> and automatic gear <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{am=aut}\)</span>.) This corresponds to the common settings of the null hypothesis: <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{am=aut} - \mu_{am=man} = 0\)</span>. In other words, we want to find out whether the difference between conditional means is null.</p>
<p>The “regression” t-test tests whether there is any effect of automatic gear <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{am=aut}\)</span> compared to the manual <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{am=man}\)</span> gear. Comparison to the manual gear is somehow hidden in the definition of the word effect. Effect can be evaluated as a comparison of one thing to another. If two things differ, we call it an effect of something (here effect of gearing). In more technical terms, effect is found as a comparison of a group which has identical properties as the reference group (intercept) except of the one under investigation (here <span class="math inline">\(am=aut\)</span>). Therefore, the regression “t-test” has a hypothesis <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_1 = 0\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_1\)</span> is an effect of the first independent variable on the dependent variable. We want to find out what is a difference (effect) between two conditional means: reference group <span class="math inline">\(am=man\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(am=aut\)</span>.</p>
<p>The two questions are identical. In a simple case without control variables “normal” t-test is preferred due to its simplicity. However, once the studied problem becomes more complex, “regression” t-test is the way to go.</p>

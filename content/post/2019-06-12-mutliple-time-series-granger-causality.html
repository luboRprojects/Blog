<p>We have recently submitted a paper about the short-term car registration forecasting. Forecasting models were based on several underlying variables which were analysed by a standard Vector Autoregressive Model. As the main purpose of the paper was not to present a black-box model with a good predictive power, we needed to analyse an importants of the car registration determinants.</p>
<p>A traditional approach to identify <em>“cause and effects”</em> in the context of time series analysis is to perform the Granger Causality test. Surprisingly, a treatment of the multivariate is not discussed much. Typically, two variables settings is presented with the caveat that solution works even for a more variables. This is only a partially true.</p>
<p>In the following text we will go through the simple 3 time-series example with various settings of interconnections.</p>

<h2>Three Variables, One driver</h2>
<p>This example shows the analysis of the tree time series where the first time series <em>ts1</em> is a confounding time series.</p>

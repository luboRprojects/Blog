I have been asked by students about the difference between the "normal" t-test evaluating differences in mean values and the "regression" t-test several times. So, is there any difference? Let's look the following example to get a practical intuition:

We will use the mtcars data set to test whether cars with manual transmission have different fuel consumption than cars with automatic transmission. 
```{r, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
data("mtcars")
boxplot(mtcars$cyl ~ mtcars$am)

mtcars %>% 
  group_by(am) %>%
  summarise(mpgAvg = mean(mpg))
```

Let's run the t-test for difference in means:

```{r}
t.test(mpg ~ am, var.equal = TRUE, data=mtcars)
```

Let's check the regression outcome (there is no need to code am as factor has only 2 levels).

```{r}
lm(mpg ~ am, data=mtcars) %>%
  summary
```
t-statics from both tests result are identical in absolute value: `r t.test(mpg ~ am, var.equal = TRUE, data=mtcars)$statistic %>% abs %>% round(3)`.

The "normal" t-test tests whether there is any difference between conditional mean values of the dependent variable $mpg$. Mean values are conditioned on the level of the independent variable $am$ (for the manual gear $\mu_{am=man}$ and automatic gear $\mu_{am=aut}$.) This corresponds to the common settings of the null hypothesis: $\mu_{am=aut} - \mu_{am=man} = 0$. In other words, we want to find out whether the difference between conditional means is null.

The "regression" t-test tests whether there is any effect of automatic gear $\mu_{am=aut}$ compared to the manual $\mu_{am=man}$ gear. Comparison to the manual gear is somehow hidden in the definition of the word effect. Effect can be evaluated as a comparison of one thing to another. If two things differ, we call it an effect of something (here effect of gearing). In more technical terms, effect is found as a comparison of a group which has identical properties as the reference group (intercept) except of the one under investigation (here $am=aut$). Therefore, the regression "t-test" has a hypothesis $\alpha_1 = 0$ where $\alpha_1$ is an effect of the first independent variable on the dependent variable. We want to find out what is a difference (effect) between two conditional means: reference group $am=man$ and $am=aut$.

The two questions are identical. In a simple case without control variables "normal" t-test is preferred due to its simplicity. However, once the studied problem becomes more complex, "regression" t-test is the way to go.

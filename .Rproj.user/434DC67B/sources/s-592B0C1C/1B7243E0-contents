I have been asked by students about the difference between the "normal" t-test for mean value analysis and the "regression" t-test many times. So, is there any difference? Let's look the following example to get a practical intuition:

We will use the mtcars dataset to test whether cars with manual transmission have different fuel consumption than cars with automatic transmission. 
```{r, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
data("mtcars")
boxplot(mtcars$cyl ~ mtcars$am)

mtcars %>% 
  group_by(am) %>%
  summarise(mpgAvg = mean(mpg))
```

Let's run the t-test for difference in means:

```{r}
t.test(mpg ~ am, var.equal = TRUE, data=mtcars)
```

And now check the regression outcome (there is no need to code am as factor has only 2 levels).

```{r}
lm(mpg ~ am, data=mtcars) %>%
  summary
```
Both t-statics equal in absolute value to `r t.test(mpg ~ am, var.equal = TRUE, data=mtcars)$statistic %>% abs %>% round(3)`.

What does this actually mean? The mean-value t-test tests whether difference between $\mu_{am=aut} = \mu_{am=man}$, which can be rewritten as $\mu_{am=aut} - \mu_{am=man} = 0$. The "regression" t-test tests whether the effect of having $am=aut = 0$.
